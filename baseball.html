    The New York Yankees are one of the greatest baseball franchises in the history of professional baseball. They have won 27 World Series Championships which is an MLB record.
    The Yankees are also known as the Bronx Bombers because they play in Bronx, New York City. They play in the East division of the American League (AL). Over 40 Yankees players have been 
    inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Some include Babe Ruth, Lou Gherig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, and more. One of the most recent Yankee players to retire is Derek Jeter. 
    Derek Jeter was one of the best short-stops to ever play the game of baseball. He played on the Yankees for 22 years until he retired in 2014.
